<p>The Newhouse School at Syracuse University holds a "Pixels & Print" design workshop for students in the Multimedia Photography & Design department. I was one of four developers chosen to execute the designs that the students put together during the workshop. We volunteered our time to develop and launch the site and continue to maintain it. It was an amazing experience to collaborate with design faculty and students at Newhouse and to help an organization with such a powerful mission. <p class="italic">View the site <a href="http://www.oneintwenty.org/" target="_blank">live</a></p></p>
