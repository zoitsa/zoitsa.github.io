<p>I worked on this website while employed at 3Pound Health, LLC. The original website was internally focused while starting up. Overtime, it outgrew its corporate website (3poundhealth.com) and needed rebranding and seamless integration with the product website/dashboard (myeuco.com). The main goal for the new site was to give prospective customers enough information about the product's value and direct them to sign up for a live demo. <p class="italic">3Pound Health closed in April, 2016 and has recently taken its website offline.</p></p>
