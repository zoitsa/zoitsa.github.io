			<p>I am an entrepreneur and web developer. I like to create things and watch them grow, whether they are ideas, small projects or full-scale ventures. I own ZCK Digital Solutions, LLC and am a Cofounder and web developer at <a href="upstate.agency" target="_blank">Upstate Interactive</a>.</p>

			<p>Most of my experience includes working on the customer-facing side of software startups. Through my experience, I â€˜ve realized how important it is for more people to learn the basics of software development, in order to improve team communication and decision-making. </p>

			<p>Coding has completely opened up my mind to endless opportunities to create, collaborate, and continuously learn new things. One of my personal missions is to increase accessibility for coding resouces in my community. </p>
